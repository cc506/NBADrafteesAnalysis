Strength and explosiveness to finish through contact easily and hang in the air ... Impacts the game on both ends of the floor ... Foot work and body control are like a guard's at 280 lbs ... Has an incredibly explosive second jump with the touch and concentration to finish ... Underrated length with a near 6'11 wingspan ... Tremendous anticipation, which allows him the ability to play a step ahead of opponents ... A nightmare to defend in space ... Very well coordinated movement for someone with his size and youth. Incredibly smooth and light on his feet at size. Agile and nimble ... Ability to catch the ball, gather and quickly change direction, avoid defender ... Excellent acceleration with the ball in hands, blows by guys playing off him, beats guys to spot ... Good motor on offensive glass, strong along with leaping ability ... Good hands ... Catches tough passes, gets 50/50 balls ... Wide frame makes it hard to get around him for defenders to contest, able to finish around and through defenders ... He is a freight train in the open court and nearly impossible to stop with his combination of size, speed and ball skills ... Often beats double and triple teams with both strength and finesse ... Strong enough to finish through contact, able to get to rim at a high rate ... Good court vision and solid decision making ... Imaginative passer and play maker ... Solid recognition of defensive schemes, unselfish, looks for teammates ... Recognizes traps and double teams, doesn’t panic, moves the ball intelligently ... Ball handling moves and shiftiness is super high level at size/age ... Very coachable. Absorbed a lot of instruction and improved his skill set at Duke ... Good hand eye coordination, able to split traps, keep dribble low, very quick hands ... Very effective in and out dribble in transition ... Has a solid spin move off the dribble and a quick behind the back dribble as well. Natural instincts for where defense is coming from and going to, instinctual dribble counters ... Nice outlets, keeps his head up in transition Defensive instincts ... Good anticipation on blocks, pins shots w/o goal tending or fouling and allows for team to recover ... When he tries, moves feet well on perimeter, quick hands, changes direction well ... Plays defensive back well, baiting opposing guards to throw a pass to his guy and then jumping the pass for an easy steal with his great closing speed ... Quick hands, gets a lot of strips and deflections ... Has shown improvement on pull ups and step back jumpers, looks fluid, getting squared, going straight up but hasn’t made them with great accuracy so far ... Magnetic personality, natural entertainer, great kid off the court by all accounts ... As long as he continues to develop, intangibles are in place to be a future star ... Great conditioning, especially considering his body type ... ","Playing style and weight puts a lot of pressure on his legs and feet. The question begs to be asked whether he can stay on the floor for a lengthy NBA career ... He will likely need to drop another 15-20 lbs in order to sustain his playing style ... 250-260 lbs would be ideal. But may not be possible ... Shot is somewhat flat with awkward release position, from the side of his head ... Is developing into a capable shooter but still needs refinement ... Plays with a great deal of emotion, but at times that emotion can get the best of him as he struggles to contain it ... Will need to work on not getting too emotional as the 82 game NBA season is a long one and can burn out players that put too much into each and every game ... Can get a little out of control at times, needs perimeter game to develop to be less predictable ... A good portion of his points come through overpowering less physically developed players, which will not work as well at the next level ... Jumper is flat, needs more arch ... Struggles to shoot from the perimeter in rhythm ... Is much more adept at spotting up when defenders sag off of him than creating shots with defenders on him ... Needs to work on polishing a pull up jumper ... Poor effort defensively at times and does not always get in a low stance, even though he can sometimes make up for it with his unique athleticism ... Loses focus defensively at times, gambles for blocks and steals ... Not always in great position, at times late on rotations ... Back to the basket game could use some work ... "

Defends well inside and is eager to protect the rim (2.7 blocks per game) ... ","As impressive as he played early in his freshman season, his inability to stay on the floor due to injury calls into question his durability ... Played in just 9 games at Oregon due to a stress fracture in his left foot ... Questionable how reliable he’ll be at the next level ... Whichever team drafts him will be taking an inherent gamble that he doesn’t have further health issues that derail his career ... Sudanese have extremely thin bodytypes, and his body needs a lot of work ... Putting good basketball weight on could be a challenge ... Sometimes forces shots that aren’t there ... He’s still figuring out how to best take advantage of his physical tools ... Needs to learn to let the game come to him better ... Could do a better job of passing out of double-teams and finding the open man and cutters (1 assist and 2 turnovers per game) ... While he is capable of running the floor well in transition, doesn’t always hustle as well as he could ... Still pretty wiry. Needs to do a better job of handling contact inside ... Projects to have a substantial learning curve as he heads into the NBA ... Might be a couple of years away from being a impact player as he still physically matures and develops ... High school reputation draws into question his team focus and attitude ... Unwillingness to apply himself in interviews while in HS calls into question his focus and desire to apply himself at the highest level ... "

He rarely fouls despite contesting a lot of shots ... He’s rarely out of control despite how hard he plays ... He’s capable of switching screens and defending players on the perimeter ...

He’s a good finisher in traffic ... ","Does not have ideal size or strength to play in the post at the next level ... Lacks length with just a 6'8.25 wingpsan on his 6'8 (in shoes) frame ... To make matters worse he weighed in at the combine at just 207 lbs, which is concerning considering his age ... Will turn 23 in September, making him older for a first round draft prospect ... Revamped his jumpshot in his redshirt, transfer year, but still has work to do on it ... He needs to improve the range and consistency on his perimeter jump shot ... He shot only 27% from the 3-point line last season ... He doesn’t look comfortable shooting unless he is wide open ... His reluctancy to shoot could affect his team’s offensive rhythm ... He struggles at the free throw line, he shot 69% from the line last season ... He needs to extend his shooting range in order to not be a liability on the floor at the next level ... He’s not a great ball handler which can lead to turnovers against NBA players ... He can be careless at times with the basketball, which NBA teams will make him pay for ... He can be undisciplined at times on the defensive end ... At times going for blocks too often puts him and the team out of position ... He needs to increase his playmaking skills to make himself more versatile on the offensive end of the floor ...

Explosive finisher and alley-oop target, with great bounce, especially off of two feet ... Very solid touch and shooting ability for a big ... Shows excellent form and touch shooting the ball (a career 75% ft shooter) ... Has become a load on the block ... Has excellent footwork in the post with solid ability to establish position and seal his man for jump hooks and drop steps ... Has a developing turn around hook shot over his left shoulder ... Possesses excellent hands, showing an ability to catch entry passes and make plays with the ball without having to focus any attention to it ... Has learned solid skill on the block, with the ability to seal his man, create a wide base for teammates to find him with passes, and can make plays quickly after establishing advantageous position ... Has developed a bag of tricks in the paint with spin moves and up-and-unders. Does a great job of not predetermining his moves and really gives defenders trouble with his foot work and ball fakes ... His hands appear to be just as good as his feet ... Creates space offensively by bumping his defender off balance ... Finishes well in the paint, whether it be with a dunk or baby hooks ... Ambidextrous, showing the ability to finish well with both his left and dominant right hand ... Very good touch. And an above average FT shooter for a big ... Enjoys contact. Displays great toughness and a willingness to give up his body for rebounds ... Very strong body and should only continue to add to his muscular frame ... While his skill set is more that of a traditional big with a focus on his post game, his size, mobility and touch give him potential as a modern day big, and his ability to move his feet and defend guards on pick and rolls gives him added intrigue ... Has really improved as an offensive player, showing confidence facing the basket from the perimeter and can make plays attacking the basket off the dribble ... He's able to take opponents off the bounce with a quick first step and can get to the rim without drawing charges or turning the ball over. A sign of his coach-ability and dedication to improving his game ... Finishes well on the move ... Also has the ability to one dribble pull up from 10-12 feet if the defense sags off him ... Young man with a lot of maturity and composure. Has a calm, confident demeanor and never seems to lose his cool, or get rattled ... Has a real presence about him, doesn’t shy away from competition or the limelight and shows a steady demeanor and confidence to handle adversity and tough situations ... His feel for the game has shown steady improvement, and he apparently made an excellent decision to return to Maryland for his sophomore year, despite being a likely first rounder as a FR ... Excellent 7-plus foot wingspan gives him good length at 6’10 ... ","Still unproven to some degree against quality competition, though this season he has begun to show what he can do against higher level opponents ... Offensive game, while promising is still a work in progress ... Still not the most prolific of scorers at 15 ppg after averaging 10 ppg as a freshman in the Big Ten ... While he has come a long way in a short time, still must continue to improve upon his feel for the game ... At times is slow to recognize double teams and will take the ball into the teeth of defenders, instead of working the ball out for a better look ... His ball handling has really grown into a strength, but can still be sloppy and lead to turnovers ... Doesn't have range out past 12-15 feet at this point. While his form and touch suggest he could develop a 3 point shot, to this point he has not been able to add that element to his game ... His passing at times can be sloppy, though his 2 assists per game are solid for a big and show that he's not a black hole on offense ... Perhaps just slightly undersized at the center position at 6'10 ... Will be 21 (August 15th) before the 2019 NBA Season begins, so his upside is not as intriguing as a true freshman ... Not the most formidable shot blocker or rim protector, though he's solid in this area with a chance to improve. He'll need to focus more attention to this area of the game ... "

Not elite vision but his handle allows him to make plays for others and himself ... Able to bring the ball up even against pressure ... An above average athlete. Very fluid and coordinated, doesn’t look out of place at any position 1-4 ... Will find open man, comfortable making a pass off the dribble, keeps his head up, likes to draw and kick ... Shot selection needs work but he has excellent range on his 3-point shot, already comfortable from NBA range ... Quick release. Gets low to the ground with his handle, flexible, has serious moves off the dribble even though he did not always get to showcase them at Duke as the third option behind Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett ... Live dribble counters, can stop on a dime and pull up or use size and craft to get all the way ... Handle doesn’t slow him down at all, in open court situation, his top speed is good ... When feet are set and he goes up with balance he is a terrific shooter ... Low 3-point percentages seem to be more a product of role and shot selection, but he could provide spacing in modern game ... Great physical tools at 6’7 with 7’1 wing span ... Excellent anticipation and timing to go along with length, absolutely a terror in full court press, traps and passing lanes ... His wingspan and size even allows him to be a weak side shot blocker ... When inspired, a good rebounder as well ... Not huge but solid frame, can play some small ball 4, does well with contact, fights for rebounds, can post up, understands positioning ... High level defensive potential, super versatile but active with quick hands as well ... Length allows him to cover huge distance ...","Struggled to live up to his potential at Duke and really struggled with consistency ... Deferred to teammates far too often, and never seemed to find a rhythm ... Competitiveness and toughness came into question during season ... Not an explosive finisher, gets to the basket with handle and skill more than athletic ability ... Doesn’t really get up as much as you’d expect with his length, struggles to finish in tight spaces and over length ... Below average first step, his tendency to settle for jumpers is partly explained by inability to beat guys to spots and set them up with fakes, all giving the impression that he has average quickness ... Often poor shot selection ... Loves pull up for 3s. Has a bad tendency to take zero pass pull up 3s ... Often has poor balance on pull ups, tends to lean or fade instead of going straight up ... Still learning how to run pick and roll ... Determination and dedication need work ... Disappeared for long stretches in many games at Duke, lacking assertiveness ..."

Considered a high character kid ...","Draft age is the red flag here when it comes to sneaking into the first round. Johnson was a Redshirt Senior this season and turned 23 in early March … At best an average athlete lacking standout speed and leaping ability … Role most likely to play in the NBA is a three-and-D player and while he improved this year, still looks stiff on perimeter and could struggle against athletic wings … Despite such a long frame, Johnson has troubling contesting shots while averaging just 0.3 blocks per game … Looks hesitant going into the paint and finishing around the rim, will settle for jump shots instead … Not aggressive enough to go into the paint and get fouled as he only averaged 3 free throw attempts per game last season … Limited playmaker while averaging 2.4 assists per game and excelling off catch-and-shoot opportunities … Not a post presence, all shots taken are driving or perimeter … Can rebound, but ability is too limited to become a small-ball four … only 210 pounds at 6’9, must add weight which would create versatility in his game around the rim ...

Carsen scored an impressive 24.3 points per game last season as a Junior, including three 40 point games (2 in the NCAA tournament) ... A high volume 3 point shooter, Edwards hit a whopping 135 three pointers (3.8 per game) on 35.5% shooting last season ... He has NBA range, a nice release, and the ability to gain separation against his defender ... While 35.5% from deep isn't a jaw dropping number, as a sophomore he 40% from beyond the arc on only 6.5 attempts per game on a team that wasn't as reliant on him for offense ... An absolute terror in transition, Edwards is fearless on the break, and has excellent end to end speed that allows him to use get a nice number of fast break layups ... Using his elite quickness, plus ball handling skills, and low center of gravity, Edwards is great off the dribble, and has a knack at getting into the lane ... Carsen is a creative finisher once he does get to the rim, and with his above average leaping ability he finishes above the rim at a surprising rate for a player his size ... At 6' in shoes, he has a 6'6.25'' wingspan, which allows him to play much larger than his listed height ... Pair that with his athletic ability and it helps his cause further still ... Edwards also sports a well muscled 200 pound frame that will allow him to hold his own in league with much larger, stronger players ... Although defense isn't his calling card, especially since he was asked to do so much on offense for the Boilermakers, Carsen has good anticipation in the passing lanes, and is a surprisingly adept shot blocker in fast break or help side situations, in part due to his athletic ability but also due to natural timing ... Edwards is also pretty a pretty solid defensive rebounder for someone his size (3.6 per game) and while this certainly won't be his calling card in the NBA, he does look to push those defensive rebounding opportunities into fast break opportunities, which is certainly something that can translate to the next level ... A scrappy, clutch player, Edwards is comfortable in big moments, and proved he has the ability to carry a massive burden of a college team's offensive load ... He also made significant improvement in each of his three collegiate seasons ... ","Carsen Edwards is a nice passer on the break, but is really a shooting guard, and just doesn't have the mentality of a point guard ... This gives him appeal as a guy you can bring off the bench to fill it up, but his style doesn't really lend himself as someone who projects to be an NBA starter ... As a junior, he shot just 49% at the rim (hoop-math.com) and in the NBA against longer, athletic defenders, scoring at the rim will be considerably harder than it was in college ... Only averaged 2.9 assists last season, and is more of a one on one iso player than a guy who can be used to consistently set up teammates outside of fast breaks and drive and kick situations ... Despite a nice wingspan, he only has a 7'10.5'' standing reach, which is very poor for an NBA player ... He also measured the shortest player last season (5'10'' without shoes) when he tested the waters at the NBA combine ... This will make him a guy that is very easy to shoot over, or back down at the next level. Aside from his instincts in the passing lanes, Edwards projects to be a player that will be a defensive liability in the NBA (especially since his natural position is a shooting guard) ... Despite a lot of in game athleticism that is displayed, Edwards didn't establish himself as an elite athlete during last year's combine testing ... "

Extreme quickness, keeping defenders off balance … Deadly three point shooter … His silky smooth release and dribbling abilities make him difficult for opponents to defend … Before suffering a season-ending knee injury, he averaged 16.2 points and 3.8 rebounds in his five games with Vanderbilt ... He is extremely challenging to stay in front of when he is in a scoring rhythm ... Catches opponents off guard with his open court speed ... Knows when to use his soft floater and gets to the basket with ease ... Has quick hands and is a scrappy defender ... Has good length and size for the PG position with a 6'5 wingpsan and a 8'1 standing reach ... Players with NBA bloodlines seem to fare better than the average, so having a father (Winston Garland) that played in the league gives him added intrigue ... Shot 75% FT in five games, but was closer to 85% in high school ... ","Relatively unproven, especially risky to be taken as a high/mid lottery pick without having had to prove himself over the course of a college season ... Turnover prone ... Negative a/to numbers through first five games of college career. In his limited action as a Vanderbilt freshman, he totaled (2.6 apg) 13 assists to (3.0 tpg) 15 turnovers, which is uncharacteristic for such a talented point guard ... A small sample size to draw any real conclusions from, however was turnover prone in high school as well, so may take a while to learn to become a reliable distributor at the NBA level … Sometimes struggles to make the right decision under the rim … Not an explosive athlete … Very thin frame and may struggle to put on a ton of srength/weight … May get bullied around by NBA guards due to his lack of size … Not all players recover 100% from knee injuries, so it is something that NBA teams have to take into consideration regarding his medical reports … "

Windler's superb stroke was displayed in many different ways ... Dylan nailed 100 threes as a senior at 42.9% shooting on 7.1 attempts per contest ... This type of production isn't a new development in his game as he hit 42.9% his junior season, and 40% as a soph. He's great at coming off screens and floating the corners to get open shots ... Windler needs very little time to catch and setup for his shot, and his left handed release can sometimes catch defenders off guard ... Playing in a fast paced Belmont offense many of his 3's this season came in transition which will aid in his translation to the NBA landscape ... Additionally, at 6'7.5'' in shoes and sporting an 8'8.5'' standing reach, he's plenty tall to get his shot off in the league ... Windler is also an aggressive player, who not only hunts for his shot, but hustles for rebounds, and takes advantages of cutting opportunities to get shots at the rim ... His 10.8 rebounds per game is a very good level for a player who spends so much time around the perimeter, and his 1.9 offensive rebounds per contest lead to 23 second chance buckets ... Another plus regarding his rebounding is that he's really good at pushing the pace after collecting a miss on the defensive end ... As rebounding is one of the most translatable skills to the NBA, while Windler is not elite in terms of positional size and athletic ability, he measures out pretty well and project to at least be solid on the glass ... With a 6'10'' wingspan, a 2.94 second shuttle and a 37.5'' max vertical, Dylan tested really well when compared to his peers ... He's not really a slasher, but works off cuts well, and often finishes above the rim ... He shot a very good 74.5% at the rim last season(hoop-math.com) and converts free throws at an 84.7% clip ... A low mistake player, who only averaged 2.1 TO's per game despite being a focal point in Belmont's offense ... Very methodical, Dylan uses spacing well, and will likely benefit from the deeper NBA three point line ... ","Despite being surprisingly quick and athletic, Dylan really needs to work on his strength to make the leap to the next level ... At 195 pounds, he'll likely be effected by stronger players at his position, and will struggle to match up defensively ... He wasn't much of a shot blocker in college, and will likely not be a factor in contesting shots ... Windler will also turn 23 before his first NBA game, so he has a mature game while being pretty close to his prime ... His ceiling doesn't project to be that much higher than where he is now ... One on one perimeter scoring will be more difficult in the NBA, and he will likely have to rely more on running off screens, while a good ball handler, he's not exactly a break you down or blow past you type of presence on the wing ..."

Also, capable of knocking down shots from beyond the arc (32.6%) … Capable shot blocker, averaged 1.3+ BPG during his three years at Tennessee … Very strong which allows him to finish through contact and carve out space in the paint … Where Williams lacks in athleticism and height, he makes up for it with strength, play-making ability, and motor … High motor, constantly hustles and demonstrates leadership on the court … High basketball IQ which leads to his above-average playmaking ability … Played with talented players during his tenure at Tennessee (Player: Admiral Schofield), (Player: Jordan Bone), and is capable in terms of sharing the basketball and the spotlight … Was the centerpiece during his time at Tennessee while winning back-to-back SEC Player of the Year Awards and was always a leader and set the example … Key to his game is versatility where he continues to show improvement in each area","Williams is an undersized forward at 6’7 which is small for a player who lacks in athleticism and makes most of his impact in the post … Not an explosive athlete, plays below the rim … Foul prone, fouled out of 4 games including two matchups against top talent in the country in Gonzaga and Kansas … Williams struggles to stay in front of quicker guards due to his lack of athleticism and height … While capable of hitting from beyond the arc, Williams digressed from his freshman year to junior year. Very capable from mid-range and the free throw line, but needs to continually improve from three if he plans to find a role as a small-ball four in the NBA … Hesitant to utilize jumper, typically makes impact in the post or opts to pass on open shot to get the ball into the block … Williams may struggle to create off the dribble considering we saw most of his offensive skill set in the post or catch-and-shoot opportunities on the perimeter."

His toughness will help him initially but over time he will have to figure out how to overcome his defensive deficiencies… Offensively, to become elite he’ll have to improve his vision and playmaking skills for his teammates, otherwise he’ll put himself in a situation where he may be valued only as a spot-up shooter ... A good but not great shooter, but could improve as time goes on considering his level of dedication ...

Standing 6'8'' tall and possessing a lean, athletic, 230 pound frame, Roby also sports a 7'3'' wingspan that allows him to play much larger than his listed 6'8'' height ... Isaiah has also displayed great lateral quickness, and great defensive instincts ... As a junior, he blocked 1.9 shots per game and also tallied 1.3 steals per contest ... That kind of defensive production also doesn't showcase his ability to hedge off pick and rolls, and switch defenders at a level that projects him to be a multi-position NBA defender ... Roby is also a high level athlete, who gets off the ground quickly and paired with his lateral quickness, also has very good end to end speed ... As a versatile NBA defender, he brings a lot to the table ... Roby also hauls in 6.9 rebounds per contest which is a pretty solid number due to the fact he's not always down low in the paint when shooting ... From an offensive standpoint, Roby is not a go to offensive option, but he has a solid feel for the game, and is an effective passer ... His 1.9 assists per game is a pretty good mark for a defensive minded forward, plus he has an above average handle for a forward, and is effective in transition due to the pairing of these two skills ... He also is an improving spot up shooter who possesses good mechanics, and is at least respectable out to the college three point line ... During his junior season, he knocked down 28 threes, which is almost one per contest ... Isaiah Roby's versatility as an offensive player gives him the ability to become a ""glue"" guy on offense, passing the ball, setting screens, pushing in transition, and knocking down open shots at the next level ...","Did not break out into the star some expected in his junior season, at least from a statistical standpoint ... While a good defensive player, and one who projects to carry these skills to the NBA, his scoring ability may limit his time on the court ... As a junior, Isaiah averaged 11.8 points per game overall on 45% shooting, but against NCAA tournament teams he saw this number dip to 10.9 points per game on just 41% shooting from the field ... He's still very much a work in progress when it comes to creating shots for himself, and he will need to improve significantly to be any sort of one on one threat in the NBA ... Roby also shot 33% from the college 3 point line, which was good enough to keep his defender from lagging off, but his range does not extent to the NBA three point line at this point in his development as well ... While blessed with great length and athletic ability, Roby only shot 59% at the rim (according to hoop-math.com) which is a sub-par number for a forward with his physical tools ... It's very possible it takes Isaiah the right team fit to see the floor for extended periods of time early in his career due to his offensive limitations."

The form on his shot looks decent, but the results haven't been there yet on a consistent basis ... Shot shows nice potential, even from behind the arch, but he needs to put in hours of work shooting both mid range and 3 point shots in order to develop the muscle memory and ability to hit shots in rhythm with consistency (currently shooting 30% from 3 on the year) ... Can get overly aggressive with passes at times ... Also forces the issue on drives and gets stripped or loses the ball, but for a player with his ability, learning through mistakes is the natural progression ... Must cut down on turnovers (4.9 per game) and learn to value the ball a little better ... Growing pains. He has such an immense amount of ability and is still figuring out how to utilize his physical gifts at the point guard position ... Needs to become more adept at facilitating the pick and roll ... Has a tendency to telegraph outside shots at times and get them blocked ... Body is very thin and will need to add some strength and muscle over the next few years in order to better finish drives and absorb contact, as well as not get bullied by the more physical guards at the next level ... Level of competition may cause some teams to be skeptical ...

Offensively he's paced the Red Raiders all season with 18.5 points per game (which is 25.3% of TTU's offensive output) as well as acted as primary distributor and ball handler ... Throw in his 3.6 assists per game, and he's directly involved in over 35% of Texas Tech's scoring plays ... His all around offensive game makes him a multi-dimensional scorer as he has a fundamentally sound high arching shot in which he needs to be respected from beyond the arc, as well as being able to pull up from the mid-range ... Culver's footwork and hesitation moves on the perimeter are terrific as well, and will directly translate to the next level ... He's great at drawing his defenders off balance, and has a great array of moves once he gets in the lane ... Jarrett also displays a high basketball IQ, and the ability to make a play when his team needs one the most ... Playing in such a defensive oriented system in college, Culver has great defensive instincts, quick hands, and displays good effort ...

Can also stand to tighten his handle as he makes the leap to the next level ... He'll also need to continue to work on his body ... Culver's 195 pound frame will get pushed around by larger NBA two guards and small forwards, though he does have solid legs as a base ... He doesn't have the elite run/jump ability to make up for this at this point either ... At 6'6'' his height is good for a swingman being considered at the top of the draft, but not elite ...

Standing 6'11'' and sporting a 7'4'' wingspan with massive hands and a frame that should easily be able to build from his current 220 pound weight ... Hayes also pairs this with fluid athleticism and end to end speed ... At Texas this length and athleticism allowed him to protect the rim at an elite level ... While only playing 23.3 minutes per contest, Jaxson blocked 2.2 shots per game (3.77 per 40 minutes) and altered a significant amount of potential shots, something that doesn't show up in the stat column ... These physical traits should translate to the next level and make him a legit NBA rim protector ... Hayes' mobility also allows him to hedge well during pick and roll defense, and not be limited to a lane clogger on the defensive end ... His defense is probably his calling card at this point in his development, but Hayes has offensive appeal as a rim runner/lob target as well as a player with a track record of finishing around the rim ... According to hoop-math.com, Hayes shot 86.7% on his shots around at the rim and 72.7% of his shots overall ... His massive hands also make him a high level lob target who can grab just about everything in his vicinity ... He's also a pretty solid offensive rebounder (1.8 orpg) and can be respectable collecting misses ... He certainly plays within his limits on offense, but a surprising 74% FT percentage and solid mechanics on his shot gives him some upside in the face up game ... Jaxson is also the son of an NFL tight end, and knows what kind of dedication it takes to be a professional athlete, which also bodes well for his development as a player ... ","While Hayes possesses a great frame, he'll need to continue to not only add muscle to ready himself for the next level, but also work on his toughness ... While flying though the air, and catching lobs using his finesse, he's quite comfortable, but more physical players got under his skin and he often faded in effectiveness when being bodied up on both offense and defense ... Gaining that edge may mean the difference of him being a serviceable NBA defender to one who excels ... Like many young big men, Hayes is also foul prone ... The game is still a little fast for him, and hopefully as he develops he'll be able to cut back on ticky tack fouls ... He's not a particularly good passer either, and only tallied 9 assists all season for the Longhorns ... Because he's likely far away both skill and body wise from being a NBA contributor, a team is taking the risk that he doesn't produce much offensively before his first contract is up ..."

This isn’t a deal-breaker since you don’t do what he did even if your coach draws up a perfect zone scheme, but it’s a real concern. Going back to offense is where the vast majority of weaknesses pop up. Thybulle is a near non-factor as a passer (he basically has a career 1/1 AST/TOV ratio), is not a threat in isolation and his shooting stats are, well...interesting in places.

We noticed that he runs the floor fairly well which is important for a young prospect who is still evolving. He will only be a sophomore this season allowing him time to expand on his game.,"The biggest aspect that stuck out for us is that he is undersized. 6’8? may be big enough to play a big in college, but not so much in the NBA. He doesn’t show much ability to stretch the floor with his jump shot as well. We don’t think his athleticism is superior enough to allow him to play undersized at the power forward spot in the NBA. We also need a larger sample size as he only averaged just about 11 minutes per game last year. His role wasn’t a large one coming off the bench last season for West Virginia."

He’s 6’8 and 245 pounds with a 7 foot wingspan ... In the NBA he can be a mismatch for players if he’s at the 3, while being able to matchup against 4’s ... He is a tremendous athlete ... He has great quickness and excellent leaping ability ... He displays this with his highlight real dunks ... He has improved his jump shot every season and made himself more of a threat on the offensive end ... His midrange shot has some consistency now ... He has a high motor that seems endless ... His size and strength allow him to defend both forwards and even some centers ... He is a very good rebounder on both ends of the floor ... When his shot’s not falling, he’s able to contribute in other areas of the game ... He’s able to score off the dribble against bigger defenders ... He’s able to bang down low with bigger players ... ","His game doesn’t fit ideally with today’s game ... He’s not skilled or quick enough to play the wing and he’s somewhat undersized to be a PF/C in today's game ... He struggles at times against bigger defenders ... When he drives, he usually puts his head down which leads to questionable shots and turnovers ... He needs to extend his shooting range in order to fit into the league today ... Should look to improve his low post game in order to take advantage of smaller defenders ... He needs to improve his defense ... At times he can lose sight of his man or find himself out of position on the defensive end of the floor ... He isn’t a great shot blocker, which may limit his options at playing at the 4 or even at the 5 in the NBA ... He is prone to picking up fouls frequently ..."

Excels at setting up defenders when running off multiple screens ... Has developed a step back jump shot that allows him to create his own space to get a look within the offense ... Is underrated in terms of his ability to get to the rim in the half court ... Is extremely reliable at the free throw line, shot 93.5% from the free throw line as a freshman ... Has shown major growth on the defensive end, especially in regard to staying in guarding position, understanding help side responsibilities/positioning, and playing angles ... Is adept at playing passing lanes and is aggressive in looking to capitalize on opponent's mistakes on that end of the court ... Is a competitor that doesn’t let his motor go cold, is always looking to make plays happen ... Runs the court looking for easy buckets in transition ... Is very good at pull up jumpers in transition ... Despite shooting under 36% from three, his form should allow him to increase that percentage even from the further NBA three point line. Rebounds well for a guard (4.5 per game, season high 13 against Tennessee) ... Sneaky athlete, with better leaping ability than some realize ... ","Lacks length. Doesn’t have the ideal NBA body, measuring 6’5” with 6’4.5” wingspan and had 12.4% body fat at UK’s pro day ... Struggles with his footwork when receiving the ball off of screens, often does not have them squared up and thus preventing him from getting quickly into a shooting motion ... Absolutely not a ball handler ... Can be a streaky shooter that goes cold for stretches of the game ... Not very explosive off the dribble lacking a great first step ... Lacks ideal lateral quickness, leading to him struggling with smaller, quicker players when playing defense ... When not scoring, he can have games in which he gives you little else ... Not a great passer, and he can get tunnel vision when driving to the rim ... Sometimes struggles making entry passes to the post, resulting in turnovers ... Has a loose handle and is susceptible to getting stripped when driving to the rim ... Limited athleticism could be a hindrance at the next level, and will have to rely more on angles to set himself up at the NBA level ..."

Strength and explosiveness to finish through contact easily and hang in the air ... Impacts the game on both ends of the floor ... Foot work and body control are like a guard's at 280 lbs ... Has an incredibly explosive second jump with the touch and concentration to finish ... Underrated length with a near 6'11 wingspan ... Tremendous anticipation, which allows him the ability to play a step ahead of opponents ... A nightmare to defend in space ... Very well coordinated movement for someone with his size and youth. Incredibly smooth and light on his feet at size. Agile and nimble ... Ability to catch the ball, gather and quickly change direction, avoid defender ... Excellent acceleration with the ball in hands, blows by guys playing off him, beats guys to spot ... Good motor on offensive glass, strong along with leaping ability ... Good hands ... Catches tough passes, gets 50/50 balls ... Wide frame makes it hard to get around him for defenders to contest, able to finish around and through defenders ... He is a freight train in the open court and nearly impossible to stop with his combination of size, speed and ball skills ... Often beats double and triple teams with both strength and finesse ... Strong enough to finish through contact, able to get to rim at a high rate ... Good court vision and solid decision making ... Imaginative passer and play maker ... Solid recognition of defensive schemes, unselfish, looks for teammates ... Recognizes traps and double teams, doesn’t panic, moves the ball intelligently ... Ball handling moves and shiftiness is super high level at size/age ... Very coachable. Absorbed a lot of instruction and improved his skill set at Duke ... Good hand eye coordination, able to split traps, keep dribble low, very quick hands ... Very effective in and out dribble in transition ... Has a solid spin move off the dribble and a quick behind the back dribble as well. Natural instincts for where defense is coming from and going to, instinctual dribble counters ... Nice outlets, keeps his head up in transition Defensive instincts ... Good anticipation on blocks, pins shots w/o goal tending or fouling and allows for team to recover ... When he tries, moves feet well on perimeter, quick hands, changes direction well ... Plays defensive back well, baiting opposing guards to throw a pass to his guy and then jumping the pass for an easy steal with his great closing speed ... Quick hands, gets a lot of strips and deflections ... Has shown improvement on pull ups and step back jumpers, looks fluid, getting squared, going straight up but hasn’t made them with great accuracy so far ... Magnetic personality, natural entertainer, great kid off the court by all accounts ... As long as he continues to develop, intangibles are in place to be a future star ... Great conditioning, especially considering his body type ... ","Playing style and weight puts a lot of pressure on his legs and feet. The question begs to be asked whether he can stay on the floor for a lengthy NBA career ... He will likely need to drop another 15-20 lbs in order to sustain his playing style ... 250-260 lbs would be ideal. But may not be possible ... Shot is somewhat flat with awkward release position, from the side of his head ... Is developing into a capable shooter but still needs refinement ... Plays with a great deal of emotion, but at times that emotion can get the best of him as he struggles to contain it ... Will need to work on not getting too emotional as the 82 game NBA season is a long one and can burn out players that put too much into each and every game ... Can get a little out of control at times, needs perimeter game to develop to be less predictable ... A good portion of his points come through overpowering less physically developed players, which will not work as well at the next level ... Jumper is flat, needs more arch ... Struggles to shoot from the perimeter in rhythm ... Is much more adept at spotting up when defenders sag off of him than creating shots with defenders on him ... Needs to work on polishing a pull up jumper ... Poor effort defensively at times and does not always get in a low stance, even though he can sometimes make up for it with his unique athleticism ... Loses focus defensively at times, gambles for blocks and steals ... Not always in great position, at times late on rotations ... Back to the basket game could use some work ... "
